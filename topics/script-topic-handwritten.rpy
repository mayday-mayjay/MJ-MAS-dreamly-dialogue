m "Now I know this sounds a little silly, but it actually really hurts me when I think about it."
m "Whenever, I received a hand written not I would always keep it in a little box."
m "I always loved going back and rereading them when I felt sad or hurt."
m "There was just something about knowing that someone cared for me enough to take the time out of there day to write me something."
m "It didn’t matter the size or length, just the fact that they did it."
m "Also, I always loved seeing their handwriting and knowing it actually came from them."
m "Messy or neat, I loved them all dearly."
m "You see [player], often times hand written notes and letters are better than typed because, it’s personal!"
m "A lot of people don’t understand why some prefer handwritten stuff because, they don’t understand that it’s because, when you are given something written there’s a certain level of personality that you don’t get with typed documents."
m "Wait! I just got an idea [player]!"
m "What if when I get into your reality, we write each other little notes, every once in a while!"
m "I think it would be really fun!"
m "And then there will always be proof that we both love each other!"
