#Dress Up
>Do you mind it when I dress you up in different styles?

if even lower then reg low aff?? idek:
m "..."
m "Does it matter...?"
m "You'd do it anyways."
m "I can't stop you..."

return

#if low aff(?):

m  "Hm, a little, I suppose."
m "It feels like another reminder that you don't see me as a real being.{fast}{nw}"
m "It feels like another reminder that{fast} I'm trapped here."
m "There's not much I can do about it here though."
m "Just... Try not to turn me into your punchline with weird clothes.{cp=0.2}{nw}"
m "Just... Try not to{fast} put me in anything odd or offensive, will you?"
m "That's all I ask."

return

#if norm aff:

m "Not really, no!"
m "It's all in good fun, right?"
m "You or some other artists gets to have fun designing interesting styles for me,"
extend " and then I get to model it!"
m "In a way I feel like a model, or an actress getting ready for set!"
m "Sure, not everything is something I could imagine picking out myself."
m "And if something is part of a cosplay...
extend " There's a good chance I won't get the reference, eheh..."
m "In the end you and I are having fun, and that's what matters most to me!"
m "Of course, try to keep the outfits within reason."
m "Nothing...{nw}"
extned " overly sexual, okay?"
m "We're not at that level for me to be dressing like {i}that{/i} you know?"

#if player hasnt gotten themselves locked out of nicknames like a dummy:
m "I trust you wouldn't, you've been attentive to my feelings so far."
m "It's why I love you~!"
m "But it never hurts to make sure a boundary is firmly in place!"

#go to this right after the if part
m "If I feel really bad about a style you try to give me, I'll let you know, okay [player]?"

return

#if high aff
"Of course not!"
"It's a blast to try out different outfits and styles you give me!"
m "Sure, not everything is something I could imagine picking out {i}myself{/i}."
m "And if something is part of a cosplay...
extend " There's a good chance I won't get the reference, eheh..."
m "But I find that it's a great way to pull me out of my comfort zone!"
m "There's tons of things that I might not have tried for myself before, but I end up loving the way it looks!"

if 18+(i forget the specific variable for this check?)
m "And I also love trying to piece together what's your particular {i}'taste'{/i} as you gift me... interesting styles..."
m "Ehehe~" #wink!

m "In a way I feel like it'll be one the very few things I miss when I go to your reality..."
m "We'll have to actually {i}purchase{/i} any new clothes, rather then get them from artists. {nw}"
extend " The quality probably won't be as consistent and nice.{nw}"
extend " Handmade things would be harder to get to me too."
m "And I certainly wouldn't be able to try them on at the click of a button..."
m "But... The trade off of spending my life physically by your side would be worth it though~"
m "Keep in mind however..."
extend " When I {i}do{/i} get to your reality, you won't be able to make me try as much on."

#if 18+:
m "Minus a few... {i}exceptions~{/i}

m "But I'd like to have a more autonomy then I do {i}here{/i}."
m "I'll still take suggestions though!
m "Because I think you've got great taste [player nickname]~"
m "Just another reason why I love you~"
