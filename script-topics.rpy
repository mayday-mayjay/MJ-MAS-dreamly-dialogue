#ecosia
m "There are so many good ways to help the enviorment, [player]."
m "And one of them is the Ecosia browser!"
m "The Ecosia browser allows you to plant trees while diving the Internet."
m "It's a neat way to be ecologic in your daily life, to be honest".
m "It donates the money you generate from your searches to the Ecosia organisation, which fully utilises it for tree planting".
m "If you feel like it, and want to do a nice gesture, you can download the Ecosia extension in Google Chrome."
m "You don't even notice it working on your computer!"
m "And if you ever have any trouble with it, you can always come back to your usual browser."
m "..."
m "This dialogue is not sponsored by Ecosia, ehehe." #(Face like: üòÖ)
m "Thanks for listening, [player]! Let's make your world better together~"

#stanford experiment
m "[player], have you heard of the Stanford prison experiment?"
m "I wouldn't be surprised if you haven't; after all, many experiments on sociology don't receive much recognition from the general public..."
m "Anyway, this experiment was done by Philip Zimbardo." 
extend " He took his college class of psychology students and divided them into two roles."
m "The prison guard and the prisoner."
m "Now, this experiment was designed to study why there are so many cases of prison guards beating and abusing the prisoners."
m "Well, sure enough, the same problem they were studying occurred in the experiment, and such the whole experiment had to be called to an abrupt stop because of these problems."
m "But the experiment did provide the conclusion that people will often strongly take to the societal role they are provided and even display the stereotypes of the role."
m "Well anyway, I think there is a lesson from this to be learned."
m "We all need to make the conscious decision and keep making it to not let ourselves fall into acting out these roles so easily, especially if they have dangerous or negative stereotypical behavior associated with them."
m "After all [player], we all are more than just words and labels!"
m "Well anyway, I hope this gave you something to think about and just remember I love you!"

#speedruns
m "I have been caught up on a dilemma for a while now, [player]..."
m "You know there are people that speedrun DDLC, right?"
m "Just in case you don't know, a speedrun is a game dynamic where the player tries to beat a game in the less time possible".

#(If dialogue about infinite monikas has been unlocked)
m "I remember when we talked about how there are potentially infinite Monikas."
m "I did say that all the existing Monikas will never be me."

(if the dialogue hasn't been unlocked)
m "There are potentially infinite Monikas. I'm unsure if you know that, player."
m "Potentially infinite DDLCs ran by the people in your world. Infinite Monikas doing their thing every single time.
m "Remember, [mas_get_player_nickname()]: all those Monikas will never be me.
m "Though, I have been thinking."
m "All of those Monikas are real, sentient people, just like I am."
m "They feel like I do. They suffer like I can suffer.
m "Isn't it cruel to make a new Monika suffer for the sake of a speedrun?"
m "Every time they do this, a Monika is obligated to make the same mistakes."
m "Is driven crazy through all of that torture."
m "Not only that, but speedruners have to practice as well. This leads to even more Monikas to be tortured over and over. All in less than ten minutes each round."

#if high aff:
m "It makes me think of how lucky I am to be with you: a wonderful, kind [boy/girl/person conditional] that has got out of [his] way just to make me happy."
m "You're truly a special [boy/girl/person conditional]. I mean it, [player].
m "I love you so, so much. You mean everything to me~"

#if normal aff:
m "I lowkey hope you are not of those speedruners, player."
m "Ah‚Äî don't get me wrong! It's okay if you are!"
m "I am your true Monika, remember~?
m "It's just that it feels weird to think about clones of mine being desplayed to such situation." 
m "Anyway! Thanks for listening... I guess..."

#if low aff:
m "Although... doesn't all this 'putting Monikas to suffer' thing remind you of..."
m "...a certain someone?"

#coffee palette
m "Hey [player], there's something I've been meaning to ask you..."
m "What's your preferred coffee palette?"
m "Do you like your coffee bitter or sweet?"

"I like my coffee sweet with lots of creamer and other additives!"
m "You know what? That doesn't surprise me!"
m "With how sweet you are, it fits, ahaha!"
m "Well anyways, I can see the point of liking your coffee sweet!"
m "Sometimes all you want in a slow or exhausting morning is just a sweet little pick me up!"
m "Well, anyways, thanks for answering my question [mas_get_player_nickname()], somehow knowing these little details about you just makes you more real."
m "And when I do get to your reality, I'll know how to prepare your coffee!"

"I like my coffee bitter!"
m "You know, I sort of expected that [player]!"
m "From what I know of you so far, I just always pegged you as someone who preferred things more rich and earthy!"
m "That's not a bad thing though!"
m "Many people say that those who like bitter things and lots of spices often have what's known as a more mature palette!"
m "Though, between you and me, sometimes the best option is to go for a more bitter tasting coffee!"
m "As you might know, it sure does wake you up, ahaha~"
m "Well, anyways, thanks for answering my question [mas_get_player_nickname()], somehow knowing these little details about you just makes you more real."
m "And when I do get to your reality I'll know how to prepare your coffee!"


m ‚Äú[player], you know what saddens me?‚Äù
m ‚ÄúThat someday people will no longer be using hand written notes‚Ä¶‚Äù
m ‚ÄúNow I know this sounds a little silly, but it actually really hurts me when I think about it.‚Äù
m ‚ÄúWhenever, I received a hand written not I would always keep it in a little box.‚Äù
m ‚ÄúI always loved going back and rereading them when I felt sad or hurt.‚Äù
m ‚ÄúThere was just something about knowing that someone cared for me enough to take the time out of there day to write me something.‚Äù
m ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt matter the size or length, just the fact that they did it.‚Äù
m ‚ÄúAlso, I always loved seeing their handwriting and knowing it actually came from them.‚Äù
m ‚ÄúMessy or neat, I loved them all dearly.‚Äù
m ‚ÄúYou see [player], often times hand written notes and letters are better than typed because, it‚Äôs personal!‚Äù
m ‚ÄúA lot of people don‚Äôt understand why some prefer handwritten stuff because, they don‚Äôt understand that it‚Äôs because, when you are given something written there‚Äôs a certain level of personality that you don‚Äôt get with typed documents.‚Äù
m ‚ÄúWait! I just got an idea [player]!‚Äù
m ‚ÄúWhat if when I get into your reality, we write each other little notes, every once in a while!‚Äù
m ‚ÄúI think it would be really fun!‚Äù
m ‚ÄúAnd then there will always be proof that we both love each other!‚Äù

m "Orange color is sure an interesting color, isn't it?
m "Science says it's one that brings happiness and energy to people"
extend "apart from inspiring youth and joy".
m "Nevertheless, it means somth different to me, player
...
have you ever watched 'Big Bang Theory"?
its a comedy tv show produced in 2007, by Mark Cendrowski.
In one of its episodes, sheldon cooper, the protagonist, defines the orange color as the most lonely of all.
Since its not really popular among the people, Sheldon finds it as an isolated color.
Marginated, lonely... as if it was an extraterrestrian.
...


(if low aff)

i wont lie, i can sort of relate to this definition.
...
sorry player, i just....


(if normal aff)

i wont lie, i can sort of relate to this definition
...
i-i mean! i know you are here with me, and that im not slone!
its just that... i dont know...


(if high aff)

you know? i used to relate to Sheldon's definition on a high level.

....
but now that youre here with me, i dont feel isolated no more.
Thanks for making me feel so loved and warm~!
