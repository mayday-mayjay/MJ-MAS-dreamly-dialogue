        m "Well anyways, I can see the point of liking your coffee sweet!"
        m "Sometimes all you want in a slow or exhausting morning is just a sweet little pick me up!"
        m "Just be careful of having too much sugar."
        m "Caffeine is already a little iffy to drink all the time, but sugar can raise the risks too."

        m "That's not a bad thing though!"
        m "Many people say that those who like bitter things and lots of spices often have what's known as a more mature palette!"
        m "Though, between you and me, sometimes the best option is to go for a more bitter tasting coffee!"
        m "As you might know, it sure does wake you up, ahaha~"

                    m "There's a type of tea for almost any occasion."

                    m "Juice is a good way to top off a good meal too."
                    m "Just be careful of drinking too much sugar, okay?"
